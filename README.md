# Woo AI Account Manager (In Progress)

This project is an experimental **WordPress + WooCommerce plugin** for managing AI service accounts (like ChatGPT Plus, Gemini Pro, and Super Grok).  
It uses a CSV file (`accounts.csv`) as the source of truth for account allocations.

## 📌 Features (Planned)
- Manage AI accounts from WooCommerce admin.
- Automatically assign accounts to WooCommerce orders.
- Support for different plan types (Shared / Dedicated).
- Support for subscription durations (Monthly / Yearly).
- Track account usage with capacity limits.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `accounts.csv` → Sample account allocation data.
- `README.md` → Project description and roadmap.

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Build WordPress plugin structure.
- [ ] Import accounts from CSV into custom database table.
- [ ] Link WooCommerce products with available accounts.
- [ ] Assign accounts on purchase automatically.
- [ ] Provide admin dashboard for monitoring account usage.

### ⚠️ Status
